Filters
Filters are independent processing units that operate on data.
A filter can transform, modify, or process the input data.
Filters receive input, process it, and produce output.
Filters are reusable and composable, meaning they can be combined in different ways to form a processing pipeline.

Pipes
Pipes are connectors that transfer data between filters.
Pipes define how data flows through the system.
The data flow can be:
Sequential (each filter processes the output of the previous one).
Parallel (multiple filters process data simultaneously).
Conditional (data follows different paths based on conditions).

NOte: The Data flows in this code is sequentially.
